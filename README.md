# Intro to `react-router`

React Router v4 is still fresh off the press. it was released 20 days ago. welcome to the future. this setup will get you set up with a simple app in which to

### the approach

* routes, you say? (concepts overview & slides)
* routing: the ins & outs (these notes)
* recursive routing: becoming routine (code with me)

## install the new hotness:

`npm install --save react-router@next`

we're separating that part of the install instructions, because it's the focus of *this* discussion. `react-router` v4 is the absolute newest hotness. that's why you use the `@next` declaration, during the `npm install` step.

be careful about cutting and pasting code, and be aware that you will need to `npm init` before you `npm install`

but wait, there's more! keep going forward to build yourself a functional place to test out some of this code:

````
/* package.json */

...
"scripts": {
  "thetrap": "webpack-dev-server --inline --content-base ."
},
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^15.3.0",

... you're not done yet, we still need some files.

````
/* webpack.config.js */

module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    publicPath: ''
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader?presets[]=es2015&presets[]=react' }
    ]
  }
}

<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<meta charset=utf-8/>
<title>How's this for a route?</title>
<div id=app></div>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
````

````
/* App.js */
import React from 'react'
import Router from 'react-router/BrowserRouter'
import { Link, Match, Miss } from 'react-router'

import Home from './Home'
import Other from './Other'
import NoMatch from './NoMatch'

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to='/miss'>Miss!</Link></li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <Match exactly pattern='/' component={Home}/>
      <Match pattern='/other' component={Other}/>
      <Miss component={NoMatch}/>
    </div>
  </Router>
)

export default App

````

````
/* Home.js */
import React from 'react'
const Home = () => {return (
  <div className='home'>
    <h2>Home</h2>
  </div>
)}

export default Home
````

````
/* Other.js */
import React from 'react'
const Home = () => {return (
  <div className='other'>
    <h2>Other</h2>
  </div>
)}

export default Home
````

````
/* NoMatch.js */
import React from 'react'

const NoMatch = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>NoMatch</h2>
  </div>
)

export default NoMatch
````


#### gotcha alert

look back up there at 'App.js' and notice the distinction between the two `<Match />` components.

>when you're matching a route to the root page (`/`), be sure to use `exactly` flat: `<Match exactly pattern to=”/”>Home</Match>`

## let's doooo!

run it!

`npm install && npm run thatrap`

### Stateless functional components

We're using Stateless Functional Component declaration... React loves it when we do this.

When you use "Stateless Functional Components" you're informing react that you don't need access to a `this` keyword. Inside, during the digest cycle, React will eventually be able to make optimizations to the way it creates & manages the Components.

A stateless functional component looks like this:

````
const JustAnotherFunction = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Returning an H2 nested in a DIV </h2>
  </div>
)
````

(Other options for components are [`React.createClass`](http://devdocs.io/react/docs/top-level-api#react.createclass) & extending `React.Component`


### Make another route

This is your chance to make a simple new component, and match it to a route! So easy!

### Make a route with a nested component (nested route / nested view)

Take a look at `Topics.js` for all your inspirational needs.
